## 🚀 How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs
- **Use the Template:** All bugs must be reported using our **[Bug Report Template]**. This ensures we have the technical details needed to fix the issue quickly.
- **Precision:** Describe the exact steps to reproduce the glitch, including your browser and device.
- **Visuals:** Since InnerHue is a highly visual platform, screenshots or screen recordings are greatly appreciated to help us "see" the problem.

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
- **Aesthetic First:** We love "Apple-level" design ideas! Use the **[Feature Request Template]** for all new proposals.
- **Design Philosophy:** Explain how your feature fits into our glassmorphism-based design system and how it improves the user's emotional reflection journey.

### 3. Pull Requests (PRs)
1. **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository and create your feature branch from `main`.
2. **Follow the Template:** Your PR **must** be submitted using our **[Pull Request Template]**. PRs without a completed checklist will be marked as "Incomplete."
3. **Design Check:** Ensure your UI changes follow our **Glassmorphism & Design System** (blur, shadows, and Framer Motion).
4. **Link Issues:** Always link your PR to the specific issue it solves (e.g., `Closes #12`).

## 🎨 Design Guidelines
InnerHue is a high-aesthetic project. To maintain our standard:
* **Animations:** Use `framer-motion` for smooth, professional transitions. Avoid "instant" or "jittery" state changes.
* **Glassmorphism:** Utilize `backdrop-blur`, translucent backgrounds, and subtle borders to create depth.
* **Typography:** Maintain a clear visual hierarchy using clean, sans-serif fonts.
* **Color Strategy:** Stick strictly to the defined **Emotional Color Palette** mentioned in the Main README.

## 🛠️ Development Workflow
- **Setup:** Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
- **Development:** Use `npm run dev` to launch the local development server.
- **Type Safety:** We use **TypeScript** for a robust codebase. Please ensure your code is fully typed and avoid using `any`.
